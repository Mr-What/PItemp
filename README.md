Position and Integrator controller for Arduino

Mostly used for smokehouse temperature control.
Hence "Position" is temperature.

Simple text interface available over USB or BlueTooth-to-Serial (HC-06).
It is intended that fancier graphical apps can be written, using the
underlying serial commands as the interface protocol.
